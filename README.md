# FlickrImageGallery
Simple app that download images from Flickr

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12+
- Swift 5.0

## Informations

The FlickrImageGallery app was created with the Clean Swift architecture because it's a type of architecture that is emerging and has been shown to be effective when it comes to scalability and organization. It's little more verbose than other types of architecture but when you are usually with it helps you to see easily where the things are (view, service call, business logic, etc)

I tried to do the app more componentized (separated cells, storyboards) as possible to be easier to maintain the code and implement more things after that.

I did all the app with only iOS Cocoa Touch frameworks, without using external frameworks.
